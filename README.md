Not liking the spice rack I had, I found a site where someone bought hexagon spice jars online,
glued a magnet on top, and attached them to a fridge or other metal surface in interesting layouts. 
Unforuantelly the jar would slide down the side of the fridge though they did stay on it. 
So laser cutting out a wood plate that attaches to the fridge by magnets and holds all the spices in position.

If doing two layers, 49.50 for diameter for first layer hole and 49.85 for second layer hole might be the best.
