Spice plate to hold up spices.

Not liking the spice rack I had, I found a site where someone bought hexagon spice jars online, glued a magnet on top, and attached them to a fridge or other metal surface in interesting layouts. Unforuantelly the jar would slide down the side of the fridge though they did stay on it. So laser cutting out a wood plate that attaches to the fridge by magnets and holds all the spices in position.
